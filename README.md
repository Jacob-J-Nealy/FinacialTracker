# Financial Tracker

## A CLI Application that tracks Income and Expense & allows the user the ability to custom search for specific entries. 

This application tracks user-entered deposits and allows users to make payments with their debit information
It also includes a custom search feature for finding specific entries based on Month, Year, or Vendor. 
I'm also planning to expand the search functionality by adding filters for description, vendor, amount spent, and purchase date.
But...let's see if we get to that!

## User Stories
Throughout the development of this application, these User Stories played a role in shaping my process and decisions. 
They served as a roadmap, helping me stay focused on creating features that would truly meet user needs. 
Each story has details for how I wanted to build an application intuitive, functional, and user-friendly experience. 
I'm excited to share how these User Stories guided the evolution of the application and brought the vision to life!

- As a user, I would like a clean and simple home screen where I can easily Add Deposits, Make Payments, View the Ledger, and Exit the Application; 
so that I can quickly access the specific part of the tool I need without confusion, save time navigating, and manage my finances more efficiently.

- As a user, I would like the Add Deposits option to prompt me for relevant information—such as date, amount, description, and vendor— 
and automatically store this data in a structured CSV file; so that I can maintain an organized digital record, 
easily retrieve and review my financial entries later, and ensure comprehensive tracking of all deposit activity over time..

- As a user, I would like the Make Payments option to ask me for my debit information and save it for later use
so that I can have better ease of use long term.

- As a user, I would a simple exit button on the home screen to close out the application when I am done with it

- As a user, I would like a Ledger Option that displays all my newest entries first with the option to 
  * Display All Entries; 
  * Display Deposits Only; 
  * Display Payments Only; 
  * Display Reports: which allows me to run a custom search by specific attributes
